There is no selection for the "best" conformer as in some of the other jupyter notebooks. This can be added soon, just seeing utility of the current suite of command-line aruments.
-->AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(pol_h, maxIters=1000) #does this repeated optimization obviate the need for the bestConformer function (copied from polymer LogP v4_4_4_alla*)

Do we want to highlight parts of the molecule?

I will delete notebooks no longer needed since they will not be in the final product and they are still on cocalc.

See what functionality there is in the crossover notebooks. --> save for V2
Branching? Temp? Pressure? Diferentiate between single polymer and bulk? --> save for V2

TODO

More details about packaging.

add labels in image preview about where attachments are

preview should always be of n=1 even for non-plotting jobs so it is easy to see what end groups are connected.

Each run in plotting run needs to re-add the end groups. This should eventually be fixed, though optimization of structure will still take by far
the longest time.


As a long-term strategy, a user would have multiple options for choosing a force field or even use their own force field.
For polymers, here are some options:

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/COMPASS_force_field

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/PCFF_force_field

A longer list: http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Category:Force_fields

Often force fields are optimized for particular polymers (see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct200251x for PLA) or solvents.
