Do we want to highlight parts of the molecule?

See what functionality there is in the crossover notebooks. --> save for V2
Branching? Temp? Pressure? Diferentiate between single polymer and bulk? --> save for V2

mmffVariant : “MMFF94” or “MMFF94s” --> the s means static and refers to slightly different parameters for nitrogen in crystal structuress. It isn't super important for us since carbon is much more important for geometry.

TODO
add details about how to run the script.
Installation instructions. Including system.Xwinrc for image display on WSL

what funcs are mmff bad for? --> carbonate is pretty bad on big monomers, but for small it is ok.

smooth out graphs maybe by adding confs or numIters --> This works in a lot of cases

How to benchmark?
Rg ~ N^1/3 Bulk, no solvent --> some runs get this! Larger number of points help.
Rg ~ N^1/2 bad solvent
in a good solvent, Rg ~ N^3/5

Other regressions possible, but we need general form of func (linear vs exponential vs ...) before we can add it.

More details about packaging.

Each run in plotting run needs to re-add the end groups. This should eventually be fixed, though optimization of structure will still take by far
the longest time.

As a long-term strategy, a user would have multiple options for choosing a force field or even use their own force field.
For polymers, here are some options:

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/COMPASS_force_field

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/PCFF_force_field

A longer list: http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Category:Force_fields

Often force fields are optimized for particular polymers (see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct200251x for PLA) or solvents.
