Do we want to highlight parts of the molecule?

See what functionality there is in the crossover notebooks. --> save for V2
Branching? Temp? Pressure? Diferentiate between single polymer and bulk? --> save for V2

accessory script for random mix of monomers.

throw an error when non-palindromic end group is provided without an asterisk.

add labels in image preview about where attachments are

Each run in plotting run needs to re-add the end groups. This should eventually be fixed, though optimization of structure will still take by far
the longest time.


As a long-term strategy, a user would have multiple options for choosing a force field or even use their own force field.
For polymers, here are some options:

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/COMPASS_force_field

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/PCFF_force_field

A longer list: http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Category:Force_fields

Often force fields are optimized for particular polymers (see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct200251x for PLA) or solvents.
