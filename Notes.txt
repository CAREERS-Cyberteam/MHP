Do we want to highlight parts of the molecule?

See what functionality there is in the crossover notebooks. --> save for V2
Branching? Temp? Pressure? Diferentiate between single polymer and bulk? --> save for V2

mmffVariant : “MMFF94” or “MMFF94s” --> the s means static and refers to slightly different parameters for nitrogen in crystal structuress. It isn't super important for us since carbon is much more important for geometry.

TODO
static parameters should be easily accessible (numIters, num confs, etc.) Read from config file
add details about how to run the script.
Installation instructions.

what funcs are mmff bad for?

smooth out graphs maybe by adding confs or numIters
python3 MakePolymer.py -n 7 -b "CC(c1ccccc1)" -c XMHP -p -v -q gives vertical graph with n = 0 in all places
python MakePolymer.py -n 7 -m Ethylene -p -v -c XMHP -q fails with OSError: File error: Invalid input file tmp.sdf even though the file exists.
Replacing Styrene in above command makes it work. Vinylalcohol breaks but Butylene_Adip ok.
Adding end group Methoxy to Vinylalcohol makes it work.

How to benchmark?
Rg ~ N^1/3 Bulk, no solvent
Rg ~ N^1/2 bad solvent
in a good solvent, Rg ~ N^3/5

Each run in plotting run needs to re-add the end groups. This should eventually be fixed, though optimization of structure will still take by far
the longest time.

As a long-term strategy, a user would have multiple options for choosing a force field or even use their own force field.
For polymers, here are some options:

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/COMPASS_force_field

http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/PCFF_force_field

A longer list: http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Category:Force_fields

Often force fields are optimized for particular polymers (see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct200251x for PLA) or solvents.
