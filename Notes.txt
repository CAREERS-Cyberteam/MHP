Sander:
What is the database in DBgenerate.py for? 
From what I can gather from skimming is that this runs calculations on cocalc?
Some of the functions that generate mol objects in rdkit are not present since rdkit is imported but never used.
For now, I'll work on translating the notebooks to python and making them more general.

Examples of running the generatePolymer function in MakePolymer.py

python3 MHPcalculator.py -n 3 -m Styrene
-->Hydrogen 3 Styrene Hydrogen

python3 MHPcalculator.py -n 3 -s 2 "CC(C(=O)OCCCC)" "CC(C)"
Hydrogen 3 ['2', 'CC(C(=O)OCCCC)', 'CC(C)'] Hydrogen

Need to add SMILES support for initiator and terminator
