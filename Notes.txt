There is no selection for the "best" conformer as in some of the other jupyter notebooks. This can be added soon, just seeing utility of the current suite of command-line aruments.
-->AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(pol_h, maxIters=1000) #does this repeated optimization obviate the need for the bestConformer function (copied from polymer LogP v4_4_4_alla*)

Do we want to highlight parts of the molecule?

I will delete notebooks no longer needed since they will not be in the final product and they are still on cocalc.

TODO

More details about packaging.

See what functionality there is in the crossover notebooks. --> save for V2

Branching? Temp? Pressure? Diferentiate between single polymer and bulk? --> save for V2
